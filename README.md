For Practicing Data Science

To Understand Data Science and demonstrate my understanding skills i chose this place.

Everything in this world is majorly a classification problem. 

My Entire Repository will be mainly focusing on Classification Usecases and pet projects.


1. Pet Classification   ( Image Classification )
    
    Neural Network                   :  CNN (Conv Neural Net)
    Data Source                      :  Google Drive (Self Customized Imaged Data Set)
    Programming                      :  Python
    Deep Learning Libraries          :  Keras with Tensorflow as backed
    Loss Function                    :  Binary Cross Entropy
    Optimizer                        :  Adam Optimizer
    Padding                          :  Valid
    Conv Layers                      :  3
    Max Pool layers                  :  3
    Dense Layers                     :  2  ( one for final output and one for connector)
    Input Pixel orientation          :  oriented to 150*150 
    Standardization                  :  /= 255
    Decay Rate                       :  learning_rate_V / epochs_V
    Evaluation Metric                :  accuracy
    epoch                            :  Dynamic but settled around 40.
