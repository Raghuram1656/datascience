For Practicing Data Science

To Understand Data Science and demonstrate my understanding skills i chose this place.

Everything in this world is majorly a classification problem. 

My Entire Repository will be mainly focusing on Classification Usecases and pet projects.


1. Pet Classification   ( Image Classification )
    
    Neural Network                   :  CNN (Conv Neural Net)
    Data Source                      :  Google Drive (Self Customized Imaged Data Set)
    Programming                      :  Python
    Deep Learning Libraries          :  Keras with Tensorflow as backed
    Loss Function                    :  Binary Cross Entropy( just because either cat or dog)
    Optimizer                        :  Adam Optimizer 
    Padding                          :  Valid
    Conv Layers                      :  3
    Max Pool layers                  :  3
    Dense Layers                     :  2  ( one for final output and one for connector)
    Input Pixel orientation          :  oriented to 150*150 
    Standardization                  :  /= 255
    Decay Rate                       :  learning_rate_V / epochs_V
    Evaluation Metric                :  accuracy
    epoch                            :  Dynamic but settled around 40.




Orientation vs Magnitude: 
                          This is to compare Cosine Similarity Vs Dot Product. Cosine Similarity works based on the principle of Orientation and the otherone works on the principle of Magnitude. 

We normalize data, when data follows a Gaussian distribution.
We Log Transform and Scale[0,1] when data follows a Power-law distribution.
If  the data is probably a Poisson distribution then,If you have enough data, convert the data to quantiles and scale to [0,1].

In NLP, if we are looking for Similarity measures, then inherently we are trying to compare embeddings. 

A DNN that learns embeddings of input data by predicting the input data itself is called an autoencoder.
