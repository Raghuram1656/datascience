Incoming Image Notice:

1. Read the pdf
2. Count the Number of Pages
3. Split  pdf into each page and keep it in a temp folder
4. Convert from pdf to jpg
4. Then classify each jpg page and get argmax of each page
5. Have a Multi Class Classifier Page which combines the text and Brings up a final Reason Code




Training:

1. Read the Image
2. Count the Number of Pages
3. If count > 1:
      then create a seperate folder and move that Image to a seperate folder
      split pdf
      Label Carefully as per the categories.
   Else
      Label single page Image.
