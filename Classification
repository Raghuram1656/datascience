Dont waste time in understanding gritty nitty of how they were invented, code behind it and maths behind it. 
Learn by doing multiple examples experimentally. 


To have this we must follow a approach

1. Define the Problem Statement
2. Understand The data
3. Fix the Data (Pre Process/ Data Cleaning/ Standardization/Normalization/Regularization)
4. Split the Data (Train/Test)
5. Apply Classification Algorithms (Try on Many algorithms which serve purpose)
6. Evaluate the results and choose the best algorithm
7. Look at the output and Tune the algorithm further to more improve the results(Ensembles)
8. prepare and present your results
